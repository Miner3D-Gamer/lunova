## How to contribute (For friends):

### Setup (From 0 to ready):

- Install VS Code
- Create Github account
- Tell me about your account so I can add it to the Collaborators list
- Accept the collaboration invite
- Open VS Code and open a new folder
- Go to the `Extensions` tab on the left and install `GitHub Pull Requests` + `rust`(Restart VS Code to apply)
- Open `Source Control` tab (on the left) and download `git`
- Restart your computer to finalize the `git` installation
- Reopen VS Code
- Execute the following command in the VS Code terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Miner3D-Gamer/lunova`
- Execute the following command in the VS Code terminal: `cd lunova`
- Now Execute this: `git checkout -b YourName` (`YourName` but be lowercase and not include spaces)

You have now created your own environment (branch) in which no one will disturb you.

### Contributions:

- Make changes to the code
- Go to the "Source Control" tab on the left (Right-click on the bar if it isn't visible)
- If the button says `Pull`, click it to receive updated code from the `main` branch
- Select which file changes you'd like to upload
- Describe your changes in the text box and press `Commit` (It will say `Publish Branch` instead if it's the first time)

### Done!

Changes from your branch will automatically be merged with the `main` branch by me
